# Cloud Run
* Run stateless containers. Write dockerfile and push it. So language limits
* Cloud Run services are regional, automatically replicated across multiple zones
* Pay when your app is running, billed to the nearest 100th millisecond.
* By default Cloud Run container instances can receive many requests at the same time (up to a maximum of 80). Note that in comparison, Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) solutions like Cloud Functions have a fixed concurrency of 1.

# Cloud Functions
* Event-driven serverless compute platform same as AWS lambda
* Supports Go, Python, Node
* There are two distinct types of Cloud Functions: HTTP functions and background functions.
